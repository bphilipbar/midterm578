\section{Conservation}

We expect the following quantities to be physically conserved: mass h, momentum or mass velocity, $hu$ and $hv$, and
energy 0.5($hv^2$+$gh^2$). Potential vorticity is only looked at in the 2D solver. 

\subsection{1D Conservation Laws}
Investigation of conservation laws in the 1D solver shows differences
between the conserved quantities Figure~\ref{fig:1D_cons}. The mass is hypothetically guessed to be strictly conserved by the scheme along wiht 
momentum unless there are reflections when the walls take some of the momentum. What we observe is mass, momentum, and energy are not conserved 
adequetly because of the inherent nature of the numerical schemes inability to capture solutions at the non-linear shocks.

\subsection{2D Conservation Laws}

The conservation laws are analyzed using the two-step Richtmeyer 2D solver and show similar discrepencies
failing to show the quantities mass, momentum and energy are adequetly conserved Figure~\ref{fig:2Dcons_A}. 
In the 2D scheme the conserved quantities are again hypothetically guessed to be strictly conserved. The energy 
conservation is shown to suffer from the same flaws in the numerical scheme as before, and does not initially conserve
energy similar to 1D. Therefore mass, momentum and energy are not adequetly conserved as before, which leads to the same
presumption given for the 1D case.

The potential vorticity is given by this formula,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:13}
\frac{\partial hv}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial hu}{\partial y} 
\end{equation}
and should be conserved. We show it to be conservatived using the 2D two-step method
of Richtmeyer Figure~\ref{fig:2Dcons_B}.

We draw the conlusion that the physical quantities mass, momentum and energy are not adequetly conserved due to the inability of
the applied numerical schemes due to the inability to capture the spurious oscilations produced by shocks for both the 1D and 2D methods.
Finally we have shown
